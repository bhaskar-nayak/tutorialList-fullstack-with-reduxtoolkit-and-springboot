"The TutorialList page features a user interface with a form that displays a list of tutorials retrieved from the Spring Boot back-end. The data is fetched using Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk and managed in state using createSlice. The application's state is stored in a Redux store, ensuring smooth data flow and consistent state management. Users can easily add, edit, or delete tutorials using the corresponding buttons provided in the UI."
