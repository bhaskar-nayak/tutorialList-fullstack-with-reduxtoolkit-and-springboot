##TutorialList page
"The TutorialList page features a user interface with a form that displays a list of tutorials retrieved from the Spring Boot back-end. The data is fetched using Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk and managed in state using createSlice. The application's state is stored in a Redux store, ensuring smooth data flow and consistent state management. Users can easily add, edit, or delete tutorials using the corresponding buttons provided in the UI."

#Add Tutorial
"The Add Tutorial page allows users to add new tutorials by filling out a form. The form is managed using the useForm hook, which provides an easy way to handle form state and validation. When a user enters information in the form fields, the data is submitted and stored in the MySQL database using the Spring Boot back-end API. This seamless process enables users to add new tutorials quickly and efficiently."
